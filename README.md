# ArduinoDistanceDetector

## Description
This is a program used to run the distance detector device on the Arduino board. It reads the current distance of the object in front of it and decides if it is moving closer or farther, and if it is speeding up or slowing down. This process is automated by looping function calls over wifi using a Bash script.

## Warning
This program will not run on your computer the way that it is. This project was created to run for personally my computer and using my arduino board using the curcuit pins that I put in place. This repository is stricty for observing purposes. I highly recommend watching the demonstration video.
