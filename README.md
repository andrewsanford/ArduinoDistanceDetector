# ArduinoDistanceDetector

## Description
This is a program used to run the distance detector device on the Arduino board. It reads the current distance of the object in front of it and decides if it is moving closer or farther, and if it is speeding up or slowing down. This process is automated by looping function calls over wifi using a Bash script.

## Arduino Language
The Arduino language is basically C with a continuous loop. Instead of being an executable file, they are manifested into files called "sketches", which are made to run on Arduino's IDE (which bridges the computer to the Arduino board).

## Warning
This program will not run on your computer the way that it is. This project was created to run for personally my computer and using my arduino board using the curcuit pins that I put in place. This repository is stricty for observing purposes. I highly recommend watching the demonstration video.
